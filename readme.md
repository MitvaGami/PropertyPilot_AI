# Real Estate AI Assistant: Automated Lead Qualification & Property Inquiry System

## üåü Project Overview

This project introduces a foundational AI-powered conversational agent designed to significantly enhance the operational efficiency of a small to medium-sized real estate firm, particularly within the dynamic Indian market. Moving beyond the scope of a full CRM, this solution targets a critical business pain point: automating the initial stages of lead qualification and providing instant, accurate responses to common property inquiries.

By serving as the primary digital touchpoint, this AI assistant empowers human agents to reallocate their valuable time from repetitive tasks to high-value interactions and core sales activities, ultimately driving productivity and improving customer response times.

**Key Capabilities:**

*   **Intelligent Property Inquiry Handling:** Answers questions about properties by ID, location, BHK, price range, or amenities.
*   **Automated Lead Qualification:** Engages users in a structured dialogue to gather essential requirements (preferred location, desired BHK, budget), pre-qualifying leads for sales teams.
*   **24/7 Availability:** Provides immediate responses around the clock, improving client experience and reducing lead response time.
*   **Seamless Human Handoff:** Collects contact details and facilitates a warm handover for complex queries requiring human intervention.

This project demonstrates a practical application of AI, built entirely using robust, open-source technologies to showcase a highly relevant and impressive technical skillset.

## üöÄ Key Features

*   **Conversational Interface:** Engages users naturally to understand their needs.
*   **Dynamic Data Retrieval:** Queries an SQLite database in real-time to provide up-to-date property information based on user-specified criteria.
*   **Contextual Understanding:** Utilizes Natural Language Understanding (NLU) to interpret user intents (`ask_property_details`, `inform_location_bhk_budget`) and extract critical entities (`location`, `bhk`, `price`, `property_id`).
*   **Guided Information Collection (Forms):** Implements Rasa Forms for structured multi-turn conversations to efficiently gather required lead details.
*   **Flexible Search Parameters:** Supports searching by various criteria including property ID, location, number of bedrooms (BHK), budget, and specific amenities.
*   **Basic Price Normalization:** Logic to interpret common Indian real estate budget formats (e.g., "1.5 crore", "90 lakhs").
*   **Out-of-Scope Management:** Gracefully redirects queries outside its domain, maintaining a professional and helpful persona.

## üìä System Architecture & Data Flow

Here's a high-level overview of the data flow within the Real Estate AI Assistant:

![Real Estate AI Assistant Data Flow](real_estate_ai_data_flow.png)

The Real Estate AI Assistant operates on a clear, modular architecture...

### 1. Architectural Components

*   **User Interface (Flask Web UI / Rasa Shell):** The primary interaction point for the end-user.
*   **Rasa Core/NLU API:** The central AI pipeline responsible for understanding user input and managing dialogue flow.
*   **Rasa Action Server:** Executes custom Python code for complex business logic, external integrations, and database interactions.
*   **SQLite Database (`properties.db`):** Stores all property listing data.

### 2. The AI Pipeline Explained (Within Rasa Core/NLU)

At the heart of the assistant lies Rasa's powerful AI pipeline, which transforms raw user input into actionable intelligence:

*   **Natural Language Understanding (NLU):**
    *   **Input:** Raw user text (e.g., "Find me a 2BHK in Koramangala").
    *   **Process:** User messages are first tokenized and featurized. Then, components like the `DIETClassifier` (Dual Intent and Entity Transformer) analyze the processed input.
    *   **Output:** A predicted `Intent` (e.g., `inform_location_bhk_budget`) and extracted `Entities` (e.g., `location: "Koramangala"`, `bhk: "2BHK"`). This structured information is immediately stored in Rasa's internal `Tracker`.

*   **Dialogue Management (Core):**
    *   **Input:** The current state of the `Tracker`, including the conversation history, previously predicted intents, extracted entities, and filled `slots` (which act as the bot's memory).
    *   **Process:** Rasa's `Policies` (e.g., `TEDPolicy` for sophisticated dialogue, `RulePolicy` for direct rules, `MemoizationPolicy` for exact matches) analyze the entire tracker state to determine the `Next Best Action`. This stage also manages `Forms` (like `property_form`) to guide multi-turn conversations for collecting specific user information.
    *   **Output:** A decision on what the bot should do next: `utter` a predefined response, activate/deactivate a `form`, or execute a `custom action`.

*   **Action Execution:**
    *   **Input:** The decision from Dialogue Management to perform a specific action (e.g., `action_search_properties`).
    *   **Process:** If the action is a `custom action`, Rasa Core sends an HTTP request containing all relevant conversation data (including slot values) to the Rasa Action Server.
    *   **Output:** The result of the action (e.g., a message containing formatted property data, or a validation message during a form).

### 3. End-to-End Data Flow (with Arrows)

The following sequence illustrates how data flows through the system, enabling the AI assistant to provide intelligent responses. Each step represents a distinct operation and data transfer.

## üìà Performance & Limitations

This project provides a robust proof-of-concept. Its "accuracy" is a function of:
*   **NLU Model Performance:** How well `nlu.yml` (intent recognition and entity extraction) generalizes to unseen user utterances. Performance is optimized through the `DIETClassifier` and careful training data design.
*   **Dialogue Management:** The effectiveness of `stories.yml` and `rules.yml` in guiding the conversation.
*   **Data Quality:** The comprehensiveness and consistency of the `properties.csv` and `properties.db` data.

**Current Limitations:**
*   **Limited Data Volume:** The project uses hypothetical, small datasets. Real-world performance scales with larger, more diverse training data and property listings.
*   **Basic Price & BHK Parsing:** While some heuristics are implemented, highly nuanced or ambiguous numerical inputs might require more advanced NLP techniques or dedicated libraries.
*   **No External API Integration:** Currently, all data is local. A production system would integrate with live property listing APIs or CRMs.
*   **Simple UI:** The Flask UI is functional but deliberately minimalist, focusing on core chatbot logic.
